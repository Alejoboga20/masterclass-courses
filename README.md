# MasterClass - Course Catalog MVP

This app was built using Create React App. Once you've cloned the app locally, run `yarn install && yarn start`
 to get it running.

## \***\*Requirements\*\***

Implement the website based on the phases described below.

Complete and **commit** a working implementation of each phase before moving to the next one.

The implementation should be near “production-ready” but will be a secondary consideration during the project review session.

There will be discussion about further code quality improvements and functionality that could improve the user experience during the review.

For implementation React is encouraged, but you are free to use any libraries/frameworks/tools you are most comfortable with.

Consult the internet as much as you like.
